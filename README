This file explains how to run the project for everyone who has a Linus Distribution.



You have to download the entire part of the repository and put it in your project folder

You should now change the 3 names at the top of the script:
	mainJava which is the path to your Main.java
	main which is the path to your Main
	controllersPackage which is the package containing all the controllers


Last but not least, you need to run the shell script by using the command : ./run.sh

It is supposed to work.
